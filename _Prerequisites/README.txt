To build and run any OpenAL program, you have to install OpenAL on the computer. 
With games that use OpenAL, they generally install it silently during the game's install process.
I've included the install file for OpenAL so you can install it. Note that you only have to do this if the project errors out immediately at runtime.
At the end of the SDK install, it asks you if you want to run the redist install. You have to install the redist.
